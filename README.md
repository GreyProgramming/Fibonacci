# Fibonacci
Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

Ok, so the challenge of the day is to make a program where you enter a number, and the program calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to that many digits.

As a super basic explanation, ripping from Wikipedia:

"The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two that precede it. Starting at 0 and 1, the sequence looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on forever. The Fibonacci sequence can be described using a mathematical equation: Xn+2= Xn+1 + Xn"

One of the things that I think I need to get better at is making sure I wrap things in classes, so I will be attempting to be better at that as I program from now on. It's not enough to be able to have a single page that has the functions and logic, I want to make sure I am keeping on top of my architecture.
